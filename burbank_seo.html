                <li>Gender distribution analysis reveals that while men constitute 87.3% of hair transplant patients, women represent an underserved market segment with growing awareness and demand.</li>

        <h2>5. Consumer Behavior Analysis</h2>
        
        <h3>Hair Loss Patterns and Demographics</h3>
        
        <p>Understanding consumer behavior begins with analyzing the patterns of hair loss across different demographic segments. Our research reveals significant variations in hair loss prevalence and perception by age and gender:</p>
        
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="images/hair_loss_by_age.png" alt="Hair Loss by Age">
            <p class="caption">Figure 6: Hair Loss Prevalence by Age and Gender</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>As illustrated in the chart above, hair loss affects different demographic groups at varying rates:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Men by age 50</strong>: 30-50% experience male androgenetic alopecia</li>
            <li><strong>Men ages 18-49</strong>: 42% report moderate to extensive hair loss</li>
            <li><strong>Women by age 49</strong>: 25% show visible female pattern hair loss</li>
            <li><strong>Women by age 69</strong>: 41% exhibit visible female pattern hair loss</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Notably, recent studies indicate that women report more hair thinning than men at every age group (23% vs. 18% among adults 18-65), despite men traditionally being the primary market for hair transplantation. This suggests that women may be more aware of or concerned about early signs of hair thinning, representing an underserved market segment with significant growth potential.</p>
        
        <h3>Psychological Impact and Motivation</h3>
        
        <p>The psychological impact of hair loss is a primary driver for seeking treatment. Research indicates that:</p>

            <li>60% of hair loss sufferers would rather have more hair than money or friends</li>
            <li>47% of hair loss sufferers would spend their life savings to regain a full head of hair</li>
            <li>75% of men with hair loss feel less confident, particularly in social and professional settings</li>
            <li>Women report higher levels of psychological distress from hair loss than men at comparable levels of hair loss</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>These psychological factors create strong motivation for seeking hair restoration solutions, with the desire to improve self-image and confidence being the primary driver rather than external social pressure.</p>
        
        <h3>Patient Journey and Decision Factors</h3>

            <li><strong>Consideration</strong>: Evaluation of providers, techniques, and financing options</li>
            <li><strong>Consultation</strong>: Initial meetings with 2-3 providers before making a decision</li>
            <li><strong>Decision</strong>: Final selection based on perceived expertise, results, and cost</li>

            <li><strong>Satisfaction</strong>: Evaluation of results (typically 6-12 months post-procedure)</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>Key decision factors in selecting a provider include:</p>

            <li><strong>Reviews and Testimonials</strong>: 43% rely heavily on reviews from previous patients</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Digital Behavior and Research Patterns</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Implement radius targeting around high-performing centers in Burbank, Glendale, and Pasadena</li>
                <li>Apply zip code targeting for specific high-potential neighborhoods</li>
                <li>Exclude or significantly reduce bids for identified low-performance areas</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Demographic Overlays</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Age targeting: Primary focus on 35-55 age range</li>

            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Bid Adjustments</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Implement positive bid adjustments (15-25%) for highest-potential geographic areas</li>
                <li>Apply negative bid adjustments (10-20%) for moderate-potential areas</li>
                <li>Consider time-of-day and day-of-week adjustments based on engagement patterns</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Location-Based Messaging Strategy</h3>
        
        <p>Our analysis suggests that messaging should be tailored to specific geographic areas:</p>

        <h4>Glendale-Focused Messaging</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Address cultural considerations relevant to the Glendale demographic</li>
            <li>Emphasize multilingual capabilities where appropriate</li>
            <li>Feature before/after results from patients with similar demographic profiles</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Pasadena-Focused Messaging</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Position services as premium and exclusive</li>
            <li>Emphasize technological sophistication and cutting-edge techniques</li>
            <li>Focus on natural, refined results aligned with the area's aesthetic preferences</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Implementation Recommendations</h3>
        
        <p>To implement these geographic targeting insights effectively, we recommend:</p>
